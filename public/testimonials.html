      "My wife and I tried this restaurant for our first experience of Ethiopian food — and we were delighted with our choice.
      The owner, Nirebet, was an amazing hostess, gracious in explaining the what and the how, the ingredients, the delicacies, and the traditions.
      The service was very personalized, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the food was delicious!
      We highly recommend this place and will certainly visit again to try other dishes."

      "If you have not ever tried Ethiopian food, this is the place to do it.
      The food is incredibly delicious, with lots of vegetarian options for vegans.
      We had the veggie sambusa, ASA Tibs, meat and veggie platters — everything was wonderful.
      Topped it all with a glass of honey wine. I can see them in the future as a Bib Gourmand."

      "I can’t say enough good things about Feru Bar and Restaurant!
      The spaghetti was absolutely delicious — perfectly cooked and full of rich flavor.
      We also tried the Ethiopian wine — smooth, unique, and paired perfectly with our meal.
      What made the evening even more special was the personal touch from the owner, who made fresh Ethiopian coffee right in front of us.
      The service was hands down the best we’ve ever had.
      Authentic flavors, amazing hospitality, and a memorable night out."
